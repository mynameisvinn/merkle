# merkle root
each block in the blockchain contains a summary of all the transactions in the block, using a merkle tree. a merkle tree, also known as a binary hash tree, is a data structure used for efficiently summarizing and verifying the integrity of large sets of data.

this simple implementation calculates merkle roots.
